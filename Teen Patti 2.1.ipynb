    "This project is part of the pay table design process for an Indian poker game - Teen Patti. The aim of the project is to find all possible hands with their corresponding win/lose/tie combinations. Before any calculations, here is a short description of how the game is played. Each game starts with a deck of 52 cards. The player is first dealt with 3 cards from the 52 cards and then the dealer is dealt wiht 3 cards from the remaining 49 cards. The play will see his cards before he choose to raise or fold. If the player choose to raise, his hand will be compared to the dealer's hand. The hand with higher ranking will win; the hand with lower ranking will lose; otherwise, it's a tie. The hand category ranking is as followed."
